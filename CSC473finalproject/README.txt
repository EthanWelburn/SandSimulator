The code is currently set up to run a scenario with two square planes and 10000 particles on launch (the same scenario from the experiment in my paper). If you wish to test it under other particle loads you can change the numParticlesx, numParticlesy, and numParticlesz define statments at the top of main.cpp

If you want to check the preformance, the FPS is printed to the console every second.
